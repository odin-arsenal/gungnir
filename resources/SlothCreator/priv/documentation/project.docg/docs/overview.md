## Overview

SlothCreator provides models and utilities for creating, tracking, and caring for sloths. The framework provides structures to model an individual ``Sloth``, and identify them by key characteristics, including their ``Sloth/name`` and special supernatural ``Sloth/power``. You can create your own custom sloths using a ``SlothGenerator``, and name them using a ``NameGenerator``.

Sloths need careful feeding and maintenance to ensure their health and happiness. You maintain their ``Sloth/energyLevel`` by providing the correct ``Sloth/Food`` and a suitable ``Habitat``. You can exercise your sloth by providing a fun or restful ``Activity``.
