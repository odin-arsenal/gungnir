# SlothCreator: Building Documentation with [Gungnir](https://github.com/odin-arsenal/gungnir) in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org)

Build _Gungnir_ documentation for an [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) project that contains a `DocG` Catalog.

## Overview

This sample code project was based on [Apple's Sloth Creator](https://github.com/apple-sample-code/SlothCreatorBuildingDocCDocumentationInXcode) (MIT).

**Note** 

The original [SlothCreator](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/slothcreator_building_docc_documentation_in_xcode) sample code project is associated with the WWDC21 sessions: 

- [10166: Meet DocC documentation in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10166).
- [10167: Elevate your DocC documentation in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10167).
- [10236: Host and automate your DocC Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10236).
- [10235: Build interactive tutorials in DocC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10235).

Is recommended to check them to learn more about [Swift's DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc/), main inspiration for _Gungnir_.

## Configure the Sample Code Project

To build documentation for this package, use `Gungnir`, go to the project root (where `project.odin` file is located) and execute the following command:

```shell
$ gungnir .
```
